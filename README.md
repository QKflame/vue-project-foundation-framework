# vue-project-foundation-framework

This project is a very concise,comprehensive,and highly modular foundation framework to build a vue project. It is heavily referenced by PanJiaChen's ``vue-element-admin`` open source project and this proeject's address is  https://github.com/PanJiaChen/vue-element-admin. I borrowed ideas from many projects and made a suitable for myself,maybe it can help more people to development. This project has no usage limitation about UI framework, and no usage limitation about PC or the mobile terminal. It can be used as the basic framework for most vue projects.

This project is my practice of front-end modularizationã€‚Please correct me if there are any shortcomings.
